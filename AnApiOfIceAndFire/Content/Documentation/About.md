## What is An API of Ice And Fire?


An API of Ice And Fire is the world's greatest source for quantified and structured data from the universe of Ice and Fire (and the HBO series Game of Thrones).

We give you access to data about all the **Books**, **Characters** and **Houses** in an easy to use [JSON](http://json.org/) format.

## Who are you?


I'm [Joakim Skoog](https://github.com/joakimskoog) and I build cool stuff over at [Nelly.com](https://nelly.com). If you have questions or thoughts about this API don't hesitate to send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/j_skoog) or an [email](mailto:info@anapioficeandfire.com).

## Why did you build this?


I decided to build this API because I've always loved building stuff for other developers. I also love everything about the books in the A Song of Ice And Fire series and I follow all the different fan theories religiously.
I got inspired to build my own REST'ish API after finding Paul Hallett's awesome [SWAPI](http://swapi.co). 

Besides, this was a great opportunity to try out new techniques.

## Technology used


An API of Ice And Fire is built with [ASP.NET Web API 2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn448365(v=vs.118).aspx) and [Entity Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx).
